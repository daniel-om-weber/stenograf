"""ONNX Runtime execution-provider selection for the ORT-backed ASR backends.

The names users configure are deliberately short (``dml``, not
``DmlExecutionProvider``): they are the ``[asr] provider`` vocabulary in
settings.toml and the ``STENOGRAF_ASR_PROVIDER`` env value. CPU is the default
everywhere — acceleration is opt-in. Measured 2026-07-11 (parakeet-v3 fp32,
RTX 4080 SUPER): DirectML transcribes byte-identically to CPU at ~6.6× the
finalize speed, but CPU already runs 16–30× realtime, so a meeting never
*needs* a GPU; the win is long-file ``transcribe`` and ``--full-finalize``.

Which providers *exist* is a property of the installed onnxruntime flavor —
exactly one flavor may be installed (they all own the ``onnxruntime/`` package
directory and silently clobber each other), so the wheel depends on
``onnxruntime-directml`` on Windows and plain ``onnxruntime`` elsewhere.
``auto`` picks the best accelerated provider that flavor actually offers,
else CPU. This module stays import-light: settings validation reads
``EP_CHOICES`` without touching onnxruntime.
