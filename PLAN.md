# Local Meeting Transcription Tool — Architecture Plan

Accuracy-first, fully local meeting transcription for German and English (one language
per meeting), 2–8 speakers, with optional speaker labels. Primary target: MacBook Pro
M4 Max; Linux portability planned as a later phase. A core design goal is an
**in-memory-only mode**: audio is never written to disk, only the transcript is.

*Based on deep research into the mid-2026 state of the art (four parallel research
tracks: ASR models, diarization, macOS audio capture, existing tools). Sources at the
bottom.*

## 1. Key research findings

### ASR: the German field has moved past Whisper

German WER on the multilingual Open ASR Leaderboard (FLEURS + MLS, read speech):

| Model | German WER | Size | License | Apple Silicon path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Voxtral Small 24B (Mistral) | **3.01%** | 24B | Apache-2.0 | mlx-voxtral / LM Studio (~14 GB at 4-bit) |
| NVIDIA Canary-1B-v2 | 4.10% | 1B | CC-BY-4.0 | none with word timestamps (NeMo/MPS only — see §2) |
| Qwen3-ASR-1.7B | 4.12% | 1.7B | Apache-2.0 | mlx-qwen3-asr |
| NVIDIA Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3 | 4.20% | 0.6B | CC-BY-4.0 | parakeet-mlx (~24× RT), FluidAudio CoreML (~110× RT) |
| Whisper large-v3 | 4.26% | 1.55B | MIT | mlx-whisper, whisper.cpp, WhisperKit |

Beyond raw WER, the CTC/RNNT-style models (Parakeet, Canary) have two structural
advantages over Whisper for meetings:
- **No hallucination on silence** — Whisper's autoregressive decoder invents text
  ("Vielen Dank." / "thanks for watching") during pauses; Parakeet/Canary don't.
- **Native word-level timestamps** — Whisper needs a separate forced-alignment step
  (WhisperX/wav2vec2) to get word timestamps good enough for speaker alignment.

Caveat: these numbers are read-speech benchmarks. Real meeting audio (far-field,
overlap, disfluencies) runs several points higher for every model, and there is no
public German *meeting* leaderboard — **the top candidates must be validated on our
own meeting recordings before committing** (Phase 0).

Streaming costs roughly +1.5–5 WER points vs batch across all models. Purpose-built
streaming options: Voxtral Mini 4B Realtime (<500 ms, German supported, Apache-2.0,
MLX support), Qwen3-ASR streaming mode, Lightning-SimulWhisper (CoreML+MLX,
large-v3-turbo real-time even on M2).

### Diarization

- **pyannote `speaker-diarization-community-1`** (CC-BY-4.0) is the open-source
  accuracy leader (AMI 17.0% DER, VoxConverse 11.2%). Raw pyannote is slow on Mac
  (poor MPS support), but native ports match its accuracy at absurd speed:
  - **speakrs** (Rust/CoreML, Apache-2.0): full community-1 pipeline, 7.1% DER on
    VoxConverse at **529× realtime** on M4 Pro. Mono 16 kHz f32 in → RTTM out.
    *(Phase 1 correction: speakrs is a Rust library only — no CLI, no prebuilt
    binaries. Using it means writing and building our own small Rust wrapper.)*
  - **FluidAudio** (Swift/CoreML, Apache-2.0): community-1 offline + LS-EEND streaming
    (up to 10 speakers) + Silero VAD + speaker embeddings + Parakeet ASR in one SDK.
- **Passing the known speaker count is the single biggest accuracy win**
  (representative: 7.9% DER with known count vs 16–22% without). The UI should ask.
- Realistic expectations: ~90–95% speaker attribution for 2–3 speakers, 80–88% for
  4–6, degrading further at 7–8. Overlapping speech stays lossy.
- **Cross-meeting speaker re-ID** ("this voice = Daniel") is feasible: average
  ECAPA-TDNN or CAM++ embeddings per cluster, cosine-match (~0.5 threshold) against a
  saved profile library; unmatched clusters become nameable new profiles.
- NVIDIA Streaming Sortformer is the streaming-quality leader but is CUDA-only and
  caps at 4 speakers — not usable natively on Mac (only via FluidAudio's CoreML port).

### macOS capture — fully in-memory

- **Core Audio process taps** (`AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap`, macOS 14.4+) are the
  right primitive: audio-only capture of the whole system or specific apps (just
  Zoom/Teams/browser), **no screen-recording permission, no menu-bar recording
  indicator** — only a dedicated "System Audio Recording" TCC prompt
  (`NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription`). Requires a **code-signed** helper (unsigned
  binaries silently get no prompt/no audio).
- ScreenCaptureKit can also capture audio but requires the scarier Screen Recording
  permission, shows the recording indicator, and fights you in audio-only mode.
  Virtual drivers (BlackHole) are a documented fallback for macOS < 14.4 only.
- **Keep mic and system audio as two separate streams end-to-end.** System audio =
  remote participants, mic = local user — this gives perfect local/remote speaker
  separation for free, and diarization only has to split remote speakers within the
  system channel.
- Echo: with headphones there is none. On speakers, apply macOS Voice Processing IO
  (AEC) on the mic path only (gotchas: emits 9 channels — extract one; disable
  auto-ducking via `voiceProcessingOtherAudioDuckingConfiguration`).
- Proven bridge pattern: Swift helper streams raw PCM chunks (~100–200 ms) over
  stdout/Unix socket → Python reads into NumPy → feeds the model directly. Reference
  implementations: **AudioTee** (tap → stdout streaming CLI), **insidegui/AudioCap**
  (canonical tap sample code).
- In-memory RAM math: 16 kHz mono int16 ≈ **115 MB/hour/channel** (float32: 230 MB).
  A 3-hour meeting on two channels ≈ 0.7–1.4 GB — trivial on an M4 Max. Nothing ever
  needs to touch disk.

### Existing tools — what to learn, where we win

| Project | Takeaway |
|---|---|
| Meetily (18k★, MIT, active) | Closest existing tool (Tauri, mic+system capture, whisper.cpp/Parakeet, Ollama summaries). **Has no diarization** — our main gap to beat. Mixes channels; we keep them separate. |
| Vibe | Reference for export formats (TXT/SRT/VTT/JSON/DOCX) and local HTTP API. |
| WhisperX | Canonical batch pipeline shape: VAD-segment → batch ASR → align → diarize → merge. |
| Lightning-SimulWhisper | Apple-native streaming engine (CoreML encoder + MLX decoder, AlignAtt policy). |
| UFAL SimulStreaming | LocalAgreement/AlignAtt commit policies — the academic basis for stable live captions. |
| noScribe | Accuracy-over-speed batch UX for researchers. |
| Granola (commercial) | UX lesson: no bot joins the call; user's rough notes + local LLM enhancement beats generic auto-summary. |

## 2. Architecture

Two-pass ("live + finalize") pipeline. The live pass gives immediate captions; the
finalize pass re-transcribes the full retained in-RAM audio with the most accurate
settings when the meeting ends. Every accuracy-critical decision lives in the
finalize pass, so live-pass compromises don't matter for the final transcript.

### Component decisions

**Capture (macOS):** Swift helper binary, code-signed, `NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription`
+ `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`. Process tap for system audio (whole-system default,
per-app option), AVAudioEngine for mic with AEC toggled by output device
(speakers → on, headphones → off). Downmix to mono 16 kHz, stream length-prefixed
chunks over a Unix socket. Model on AudioTee/AudioCap. Fallback for macOS < 14.4:
BlackHole, documented as degraded.

**Finalize ASR (accuracy-critical):** pluggable backend interface. **Committed
default: Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3 via parakeet-mlx** — native word timestamps, no
silence hallucination, ~120× realtime, <1 GB RAM, same model as the live pass.
*(Canary-1B-v2 was the original planned default but was dropped in Phase 0
research, July 2026: no MLX/CoreML runtime emits its word timestamps — the
PyPI `canary-mlx` package is an abandoned template, mlx-audio's Canary port
returns placeholder timestamps, and onnx-asr supports timestamps only for
TDT/CTC/RNNT decoders. The sole working path, NeMo on PyTorch-MPS, is too
slow and heavy to ship; it remains an accuracy-ceiling reference in the eval
harness.)* **Opt-in max-accuracy: Voxtral Small 24B (mlx-voxtral, 4-bit,
~14 GB)** — best German WER (3.01%), slower, text only (no timestamps).
Fallback: Whisper large-v3 (mlx-whisper) + WhisperX-style alignment.

*Phase 0 result (July 2026, blind adjudication of 161 model-disagreement sites
on real meeting audio, de+en):* **Parakeet confirmed as default** — it tied
Whisper large-v3 exactly (42:42 head-to-head) while being ~10× faster and 5×
smaller; Whisper stays as fallback. **Voxtral's read-speech advantage did not
transfer** to meetings (lost 32:38 to Parakeet, 22:28 to Whisper) — demoted
from "opt-in max accuracy" to not-worth-shipping pending new evidence. Canary
was empirically the weakest (lost every pairing ~1:2) on top of having no
viable runtime. Methodology note: full hand-corrected references proved slow
and anchor-biased; the adjudication harness (eval/adjudicate.py) is the
recommended evaluation path going forward. Language is forced per meeting (user setting, or auto-detect once on
the first confident segment, then locked). `initial_prompt`/context seeded from a
user glossary and attendee names where the backend supports it.

**Live ASR (latency-critical, quality secondary):** **committed default:
Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3 via parakeet-mlx**, run with a **growing re-decode window**
(everything since the last long silence, capped at ~60–120 s, re-decoded every
1–2 s) and a LocalAgreement commit policy. Parakeet's ~120× realtime makes this
affordable (a 60 s window every 2 s needs only ~30× RT) and it largely removes
the fixed-chunk boundary artifacts that a 10 s window would cause — live quality
approaches finalize quality with the same model. Upgrade path if it still feels
laggy: Voxtral Mini 4B Realtime (true streaming, <500 ms) or Qwen3-ASR-1.7B
streaming. Interim text shown grey; finalize pass replaces the live transcript.

*Phase 2 spike verdict (July 2026, `StreamingParakeet` vs re-decode window on
real de meeting audio, M4 Max): the re-decode window is confirmed as the live
default and parakeet-mlx's incremental streaming API (`transcribe_stream`,
retained encoder/decoder state) is rejected. Measured — the incremental API at
small right-context (the "cheap linear" setting, e.g. `(256,8)`) produces
garbage (80–90% WER, code-switching into English); it is usable only at full
right-context `(256,256)` and even then is fragile (drifts badly below ~3 s feed
chunks) at ~13× RT / 13.7% WER-vs-ref over 300 s. The re-decode window over the
reliable full `generate()` path (~110× RT at any window size) is both more
accurate and simpler: re-decoding a **12–16 s trailing window** — uncommitted
tail + ~4 s left context, prefix-committed so committed audio drops out (NOT the
naive 60–120 s window, which would be ~27% duty) — every ~1–1.5 s costs only
**~7–10% of one accelerator during speech, ~0% in silence with VAD gating**, at
**finalize-grade accuracy (~10% WER, same `generate()` path as finalize)** and a
1–1.5 s caption cadence. LocalAgreement-2 over consecutive window decodes commits
the stable prefix; the last ~2–3 s stays grey. The incremental API and
Voxtral/Qwen streaming remain documented fallbacks only.*

**Diarization:** two backends behind one ``Diarizer`` interface (shipped July
2026, commit a3ebff8):

- **sherpa-onnx** (pyannote segmentation-3.0 + 3D-Speaker eres2net embeddings,
  ONNX/CPU) — pip-installable on every platform, handles every run with a
  **known** speaker count. Embedding-model caveat from validation: sherpa's
  CAM++ VoxCeleb export flips cluster identity between segmentation windows
  (one speaker shredded into many); eres2net and titanet-small agree with each
  other and with the audio — eres2net is the default. Its greedy
  `FastClustering` cannot *estimate* a count: measured on the five eval
  segments it found 13/25/9/13/16 "speakers" where the true counts are 2–5 —
  no cosine threshold is robust across meetings (structural, don't re-tune).
- **stenodiar** (`native/stenodiar/`, optional) — a small Rust CLI around
  **speakrs**, which reimplements the full pyannote community-1 pipeline
  (segmentation → powerset → embedding → PLDA → **VBx clustering**) with
  native CoreML; VBx is what makes *automatic* count estimation trustworthy.
  Same segments: 3/5/2/3/3 speakers, coherent turn-taking, ~450× realtime
  warm (first run per machine downloads models from the ungated HF mirror
  `avencera/speakrs-models` and compiles CoreML — minutes; `--warmup`).
  Audio is piped as raw PCM on stdin — meeting audio never touches disk.
  `SpeakrsCliDiarizer` routes **estimated** counts to the helper and
  **explicit** counts to sherpa (speakrs exposes no way to force a count);
  re-ID voiceprints always come from sherpa's `SpeakerEmbeddingExtractor`
  regardless of backend, so enrolled profiles keep matching.
  `cli._load_diarizer` prefers the helper when built (`build.sh`, needs a
  Rust toolchain), falls back to sherpa-only otherwise; `steno doctor`
  reports it; `eval/diarize.py --sherpa-only` pins the baseline.

**stenodiar on Linux — SHIPPED 2026-07-11** (Windows still deferred, below).
The ~1× realtime CPU blocker was diagnosed on the CachyOS notebook as two
upstream speakrs gaps, not a hardware limit: (1) pure-CPU embedding ORT
sessions are built with **one intra-op thread** (`RuntimeConfig.
chunk_emb_workers` turned out to be CoreML-only machinery — the whole chunked
worker module is `#[cfg(feature = "coreml")]`), and (2) the CPU model
download list omits the batched/split/multi-mask ONNX exports that the HF
repo carries, silently forcing the slowest single-item code path. Fixed by
**vendoring speakrs 0.5.0 with two single-hunk patches**
(`native/stenodiar/vendor/`, see VENDOR.md; both are upstream-worthy).
Measured on the 307 s three-speaker piper fixture (Ryzen AI 9 HX 370,
12C/24T): stock 215 s (1.4× RT, ~1 core) → threads patch alone 76 s (4.1×)
→ model-list patch alone 107 s (2.9×) → **both 38 s (8.2× RT, ~6.5 cores;
embedding threads capped at 8 — past that ORT burns >50 % more CPU for ~5 %
wall)**. Turns and speaker counts are byte-identical across all four
configs (3/3 speakers). A 1-h channel diarizes in ~7 min; acceptable as the
estimate-only path, and `_TIMEOUT_S=1800` still clears a 2-h meeting.

**Deferred task — stenodiar on Windows:** same patched build without the
`coreml` feature should carry over (ORT CPU), but the throughput is
unmeasured there. CUDA on Linux is already fast (50–121× RT per speakrs'
benchmarks) and remains an opt-in. Fallbacks if a platform can't be fixed:
NME-SC k-estimation (`spectralcluster`, numpy/scipy) feeding sherpa's
known-count path, or pyannote community-1 direct (torch-CPU, HF-gated).
Ruled out: **DiariZen** (best DER but CC-BY-**NC** weights — not shippable,
and WavLM-Large is CPU-heavy); every *end-to-end neural* diarizer (hard-capped:
NVIDIA Sortformer at 4 speakers, LS-EEND at 10) — only clustering pipelines
scale to our 2–8-speaker case. Lever order for many speakers: **known count**
(biggest) > **VBx clustering** (shipped for estimates) > **better embedding** >
the 3-speaker-per-window segmentation cap (least important; a local per-window
limit, not a global one).

Diarization is a
**per-channel** operation, configured by a meeting profile set at start
(`--local N --remote M`), covering three configurations:

| Configuration | Mic channel | System channel |
|---|---|---|
| Online (1 local, M remote) | attributed to user directly, no diarization | diarize with `num_speakers = M` |
| Hybrid (N local, M remote) | diarize with `num_speakers = N` | diarize with `num_speakers = M` |
| In-room only (N local, 0 remote) | diarize with `num_speakers = N` | not captured at all |

Speakers are labeled `Local-1..N` / `Remote-1..M` (renameable; re-ID can name them
automatically later). The channel prior still pays off in every mode: diarization
never has to separate local from remote voices — only voices *within* a channel —
and each run gets an exact speaker count, the biggest single accuracy lever.
In-room-only mode skips the system tap entirely (no system-audio permission needed,
single channel). Overlapped regions flagged as provisional in the transcript.

Speaker-bleed caveats: (a) remote audio played through speakers bleeds into the
mic — echo cancellation is mandatory whenever both channels are captured without
headphones, which is the *default* way of sitting in an online meeting, not just a
hybrid-mode concern. `stenograf.aec` feeds the system channel to WebRTC AEC3 as the
far-end reference. **Settled by PLAN-AEC.md (complete 2026-07-10):** across the full
scenario matrix (quiet/loud, batch/live, built-in/Bluetooth, double-talk) a canceller
with a live reference leaks *zero* transcript lines — 37.6 dB ERLE live, −65 dBFS
residual, AECMOS echo 4.73. No energy gate or neural residual suppressor is needed.
The one real leak mechanism is *losing* the reference (a stalled or mis-clocked tap),
so the cross-channel text dedup at merge time is now an **armed backstop**: it runs
only when `far_end_missing_ticks > 0` (or no canceller was observed), and the CLI
warns with cause and drop count when it fires. Voice Processing IO was evaluated and
rejected — it ducks the remote audio we transcribe, see native/README.md;
(b) the reverse direction is safe —
meeting apps send only remote voices, so the system channel stays clean. In-room
mode is the acoustically hardest case (far-field mic, 2–8 speakers, more overlap):
transcription and diarization quality depend heavily on the mic — recommend an
external conference/boundary microphone for rooms with 4+ people; live-pass quality
will be noticeably lower and the finalize pass matters even more here.

**Speaker re-ID (optional, later):** per-cluster mean CAM++/ECAPA-TDNN embedding,
cosine-matched against a local profile store; UI lets the user name unmatched
clusters, which enrolls them.

**Meeting configuration & auto-detection:** every meeting parameter follows one
resolution order: **explicit user setting > auto-detected value > safe default** —
all settings optional, unspecified means auto. Auto-detected values are surfaced in
the UI as editable ("Detected: German, 2 remote speakers"), and because the full
audio is retained in RAM and the finalize pass is fast, a wrong detection is never
fatal: correct the value and re-run finalize in seconds.

| Parameter | Auto-detection mechanism | Reliability / phase |
|---|---|---|
| Language (de/en) | **Shipped (Phase 1, `stenograf.lid`):** function-word + umlaut/ß vote over the finalized transcript, locked for the session. Acoustic first-segment LID (sherpa-onnx `SpokenLanguageIdentification`) is the live-pass upgrade — it can lock before any text exists and feed a language-*requiring* backend | High for a de/en binary choice |
| Remote speaker count | **Shipped (July 2026):** speakrs' VBx estimation via the stenodiar helper on the system channel (an estimated count = "don't pass `num_speakers`") | Good — exact on the online-meeting eval segments; explicit count still authoritative when given |
| Local speaker count | Same, on the mic channel | Weaker (far-field audio) — the one eval miss was the in-room segment (2 detected vs 3 enrolled); detected count stays editable + cheap re-finalize |
| Meeting mode (online/hybrid/in-room) | Meeting-app detection (running Zoom/Teams/browser-call process + audio activity on the tap) → remote component exists; multiple voices on mic → local component >1 | Phase 3–4; until then mode falls back to "online" if a meeting app is audible, else "in-room" |
| Participant names/glossary | Calendar-invite integration (attendees, title → re-ID hints + `initial_prompt`) | Phase 4 |

**Whisper-specific accuracy settings** (when a Whisper backend is used):
`vad_filter=True` (Silero), batch only VAD segments (never raw sliding windows),
`condition_on_previous_text=False` always (Phase 0 found the finalize-pass
`True` setting lets decoder loops snowball across windows — up to 220 repeated
words on overlap/silence; consistency isn't worth it), default temperature
fallback ladder with `compression_ratio_threshold≈2.4`, `logprob_threshold≈-1.0`,
`no_speech_threshold≈0.6`, `hallucination_silence_threshold≈2–8 s`, plus a post-filter
blacklist for phantom phrases during silence.

**In-memory guarantee:** the default mode holds audio only in bounded ring buffers +
the session PCM store in RAM; no code path writes audio to disk. (OS-level swap/crash
dumps are outside app control — worth a note in docs, not an app concern.)

**Opt-in audio recording (`--record-audio[=path]`, default off, Phase 1):** when
explicitly enabled, the Python core additionally appends the incoming PCM to a WAV
file as it arrives — mic on the left channel, system audio on the right (mono in
in-room mode), preserving channel separation in a file any player opens. Recorded
at the wire format (mono 16 kHz int16 per channel, ~230 MB/h for both channels):
sufficient for speech playback and exactly what re-transcription needs; native-rate
archival is out of scope (would require teeing in the helper before the resample).
Append-as-you-go with the WAV header patched periodically — crash-safe like the
incremental text checkpoints. Recording state must be loudly visible (CLI banner,
later UI indicator); consent stakes are higher for retained audio than transcripts
(docs note). Recorded files feed back in via a `steno transcribe <file>` batch
entry point (re-run finalize with a better model / corrected settings, and a
source of new eval data for the adjudication harness). Possible later nicety:
FLAC (~50% smaller); not MVP.

**Outputs:** speaker-labeled, timestamped Markdown + JSON (word-level timestamps
retained), plain-text prose, and SRT/VTT export. Post-meeting notes shipped as
`stenograf.notes` (Phase 4 Stage D): pluggable LLM backends — in-process MLX
(the Apple-Silicon default), Ollama, or any configured CLI.

### Language/runtime choices & multi-platform layering

Everything is Python except one small native capture helper on macOS. The
platform boundary is drawn at two interfaces, so all platform-specific code is
swappable without touching the core:

1. **Capture provider = separate process speaking a language-neutral wire protocol**
   (Unix socket / stdio: JSON control messages + length-prefixed PCM frames carrying
   channel id, timestamp, mono 16 kHz int16 samples). Providers:
   - **macOS: Swift helper** (~300–600 lines; Core Audio process tap + AVAudioEngine
     mic + Voice Processing AEC + TCC prompts; start from AudioTee/AudioCap code).
     Required because no Python package exposes the tap API (pyobjc doesn't wrap the
     CoreAudio HAL C functions; miniaudio support is an open issue). BlackHole would
     be the pure-Python route and stays a documented fallback only.
   - **Linux: `parec` subprocesses** (shipped 2026-07-11) — one per channel
     against the PulseAudio layer every desktop ships (pipewire-pulse or
     PulseAudio itself): mic from ``@DEFAULT_SOURCE@``, system audio from
     ``@DEFAULT_MONITOR@``. No Python audio dependency; same
     subprocess-streaming shape as the macOS helper.
   - **Windows: pure Python** (WASAPI loopback via `soundcard`/`pyaudiowpatch`).
   On Linux/Windows the provider may run in-process behind the same interface.
2. **Inference backends = Python ABCs.** ASR: MLX backends on Mac ↔
   CTranslate2/ONNX/CUDA backends on Linux/Windows (same models; Parakeet/Canary
   have ONNX paths). Diarization: sherpa-onnx (ONNX/CPU) everywhere today; a
   macOS-native community-1 wrapper (speakrs or FluidAudio, CoreML) can slot in
   behind the same interface later, and a pure-ONNX community-1 rebuild
   (seg-3.0 + WeSpeaker ResNet293-LM + ported VBx) is the cross-platform accuracy
   path — same interface, CPU everywhere (see §2 Diarization). VAD (Silero) is
   ONNX/CPU everywhere.

The Python core (ring buffers, session PCM store, VAD, live pass, finalize pass,
diarization orchestration, merge, transcript store, CLI/TUI) is identical on all
platforms. Swift is the only language we write besides Python; Rust appears only as
the prebuilt speakrs binary we invoke.

UI: start as a CLI/TUI (`steno start --lang de --local 3 --remote 2`); a menu-bar or
Tauri app is a later layer, not an architectural change.

### Deployment & distribution

Swift is a **build-time** dependency only — users never need a compiler. Standard
uv-based distribution works on all platforms:

- **Packaging:** normal `pyproject.toml` package; CI builds platform wheels. The
  `macosx_arm64` wheel bundles the compiled Swift capture helper + speakrs binary
  (built on a GitHub Actions macOS runner via a hatchling build hook — same pattern
  as ruff/uv shipping Rust binaries in wheels). Linux/Windows wheels are pure
  Python. The core locates bundled binaries via `importlib.resources` and spawns
  them as subprocesses.
- **Install UX:** `uv tool install stenograf` or zero-install `uvx stenograf ...`;
  plain `uv run` in the repo for development (dev-mode fallback compiles the
  helper locally when Xcode CLT is present).
- **Model weights** (several GB) are not in the wheel — pulled from HuggingFace into
  a local cache on first run.
- **macOS signing/permissions — no Apple Developer account needed.** Free ad-hoc
  signing (`codesign -s -`) is all the helper requires; permission prompts
  attribute to the responsible process (the terminal), so the user grants mic +
  system-audio to their terminal app once (how AudioTee ships via Homebrew) —
  **verified in the Phase 1 spike (July 2026, `native/spike/`)**: an ad-hoc-signed
  CLI with usage strings embedded via an `__info_plist` section captured non-silent
  system audio through a whole-system process tap (mono 48 kHz float32) and mic
  audio via AVAudioEngine on macOS 26.5. Developer ID + notarization ($99/yr) is needed *only* to distribute a
  downloadable .app bundle to other people (Gatekeeper checks the browser-set
  quarantine flag; uv/pip installs and locally built apps never have it). Decision:
  stay CLI-launched; no Developer ID.
- **UI direction: local web UI** served by the Python process on localhost (live
  captions with speaker colors, meeting archive, click-to-jump transcript) — as
  polished as desired, zero signing, same UI on Linux later. Textual TUI as the
  lighter in-terminal alternative. A native .app stays optional and personal-use
  ad-hoc-signed if ever wanted. *(Superseded 2026-07-10: the Textual TUI is the
  UI; the web UI was dropped with the pipeline de-scope — see §3 product
  philosophy and §5 Stage C.)*
- **Distribution channels — PyPI + uv only** (side-project scope). Colleagues:
  install uv (one curl command), then `uv tool install stenograf`;
  pre-release channel: `uv tool install git+<repo>` or wheels on GitHub Releases.
  Rejected as effort/fit-negative: Homebrew (Python ML deps must be vendored into
  the formula — huge and brittle), deb/rpm/AUR/Flatpak/snap and winget/MSI
  (per-platform maintenance matrix, technical users don't need it), Docker (no
  host audio devices or MLX GPU access in containers on macOS).
- **Invest in first-run UX instead:** a `steno setup`/`steno doctor` command —
  checks macOS ≥ 14.4, triggers permission prompts, downloads models with
  progress, walks through the one-time HF token for gated pyannote weights
  (CC-BY-4.0 — investigate mirroring them to remove that step).

## 3. Locked decisions (July 2026)

- **Phase 0 data:** usable real meeting recordings exist; evaluation runs on those.
- **Crash policy:** periodic incremental finalization — every few minutes the
  finalize pipeline runs over the completed portion and checkpoints the *text* to
  disk. A crash loses at most the last few minutes of audio; audio itself is never
  persisted (this replaces Meetily-style audio checkpoints). *Revised for Phase 2
  (Option B, July 2026): once the live pass runs, its LocalAgreement-committed
  transcript is itself the checkpoint — flushed to `<meeting>.partial` as
  zero-inference file I/O, no separate periodic finalize pipeline (which would
  double GPU work to reproduce text the live pass already has). The heavy finalize
  runs only on stop. A crash recovers the on-screen (live-quality) text; only the
  finalize-grade refinement of the crashed tail is lost. `--no-live` falls back to
  a tail-only finalize checkpoint (off the consume thread — fixes the O(n²)
  whole-buffer re-finalize).*
- **Repo & license:** public + MIT from day one.
- **Distribution:** PyPI + uv only; no Developer ID. *(The original "local web
  UI direction" was dropped 2026-07-10 — see the product philosophy below.)*
- **Name: `stenograf`** — German spelling of stenographer, the verbatim
  minute-writer. Package `stenograf` (confirmed free on PyPI), CLI `stenograf`
  with `steno` alias.
- **Product philosophy (added 2026-07-10): a pipeline, not a manager.**
  stenograf's responsibility ends at producing text — the full transcript and
  the notes/summary, written into a user-visible folder. Managing, re-reading,
  and listening to past meetings belongs to other tools (Obsidian via the note
  export, Finder, any audio player). Machine state (voiceprints, settings,
  model cache) stays in the app data dir; user documents do not. Feature
  requests that add management, browsing, or playback should be declined or
  pointed at the exporters.

## 4. Fork vs. build decision

Source-level analysis of the closest existing tools (July 2026):

**Meetily** (MIT, 18k★, active) is the only realistic fork candidate — live capture,
Rust/Tauri, modular ASR engines (whisper.cpp + Parakeet), an existing two-pass
concept. But it structurally violates our three differentiating requirements:
- **Audio hits disk by design**: `IncrementalAudioSaver` checkpoints mixed PCM to
  disk every 30 s during the meeting, a final MP4 is written on stop, and the
  accuracy "retranscription" pass works by *re-decoding the on-disk file*
  (`retranscription.rs` → `decode_audio_file`). The in-memory requirement means
  rewriting the pipeline's spine, not flipping a flag.
- **Channels are mixed to mono** in `AudioMixerRingBuffer` before transcription
  ("we only store mixed audio") — our channel-separated diarization design is
  incompatible with the mixer at the core of their pipeline.
- **No diarization** in the OSS core (PRO roadmap item).
Its ASR engines are Rust-side whisper.cpp/ONNX servers; our MLX-based German models
(Canary/Voxtral) don't plug into that cleanly either.

**Vibe** is a file-based batch app (wrong paradigm; useful as a diarization
reference). **Hyprnote** (fastrepl) is product-shaped like our target but its audio
path is unverified — worth a one-hour source dive before Phase 1. noScribe/Scriberr
are file-based; WhisperX/FluidAudio are libraries, not tools.

**Decision: build fresh, but reuse components rather than codebases.** Everything we
would keep from a Meetily fork (capture patterns) is available as smaller, cleaner
pieces (AudioTee/AudioCap for taps, speakrs for diarization, parakeet-mlx/MLX for
ASR, Silero VAD); everything we would fight (disk-centric finalize, mono mixer,
Rust ASR servers, large Tauri/Next.js/FastAPI surface) is their architectural core.
Our new code is mostly orchestration glue. Revisit only if a polished GUI product
quickly becomes the priority over the accuracy/in-memory core.

## 5. Phased roadmap

**Status (2026-07-10): Phases 0–4 are complete.** stenograf 0.1.0 is on PyPI
(`uv tool install stenograf`); Stage C — the final Phase 4 stage, re-scoped
twice on 2026-07-10 (web UI → reverse-control CLI → the final **de-scope to a
pipeline**) — shipped the same day: outputs moved to a visible folder and the
meeting-management layer (index, `meetings` group, archived reverse control)
was retired; the web UI is dropped outright. Phase 5 (Linux) is designed and
active as of 2026-07-10 (ONNX backend on the Mac first, then capture on the
CachyOS notebook — dev-environment plan in §5). Phase 6 (Windows) was scoped
2026-07-11 on a Windows 11 notebook and its capture track shipped the same day
— portability audit + build summary at the end of this section. Phase 7 (the
`steno` launcher TUI — a mouse-driven Textual home screen for non-terminal
users) was planned 2026-07-12; plan at the end of this section. The per-task build logs of the completed phases were removed from
this file on 2026-07-10; they live in its git history (and in PLAN-AEC.md for
echo cancellation).

### Completed phases

**Phase 0 — Model validation. COMPLETE.** Blind adjudication of model
disagreements on real meeting audio (de+en) confirmed **Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3 as
the default ASR**; Whisper large-v3 is the fallback, Voxtral and Canary demoted.
Results and methodology in §2 "Finalize ASR"; harness at `eval/adjudicate.py`.

**Phase 1 — Batch MVP. COMPLETE.** The signed Swift capture helper
(`native/helper/`, **stenocap**: system tap + mic → framed PCM on stdout),
per-channel in-RAM `SessionStore`, and the finalize pipeline (Silero VAD →
parakeet-mlx → sherpa diarization → merged `Local-N`/`Remote-N` transcript)
behind the swappable `CaptureProvider` interface. `steno start` and
`steno transcribe <file>`, the opt-in `--record-audio` WAV tee, incremental text
checkpoints, the `--replay` file provider, and text-vote de/en language
detection (`stenograf.lid`).

**Phase 2 — Live captions. COMPLETE.** `LiveDecoder` (12–16 s re-decode window
over the full `generate()` path, LocalAgreement-2 commits, VAD-gated), O(window)
`SessionStore.view`, the `AudioBus`/`CaptureLoop`/`LiveWorker` orchestration
(single-flight inference; load-shedding degrades an over-realtime backlog to a
caption gap the finalize fills), Option-B checkpointing (the committed live text
is the `.partial` crash checkpoint; batch mode uses a tail-only finalize
checkpointer), `PlainLiveView` + the Textual TUI, and the CLI glue
(`--live/--no-live`, `--plain`, `--flush-interval`). Measured on de-1/en-1:
agreement-with-finalize WER 7.0%/5.6%, zero monotonicity violations, ~2.5 s
median commit latency, ~7–10% of one accelerator during speech and ~0% in
silence. Label-free live-pass eval harness at `eval/live.py`. Hard-won lesson:
MLX weights must be materialized on the load thread, or background-thread
inference dies ([[mlx-weights-thread-local-streams]]).

**Phase 3 — Speaker polish + vocabulary + auto-detection. COMPLETE.**
- *Stage 0 hardening:* silent-channel finalize guard, double-quit
  transcript-loss fix, first real-backend sherpa test, DER/word-attribution
  scorer (`eval/rttm.py`, `eval/der.py`, `eval/diarize.py` — references never
  hand-labeled, see open items), word timestamps retained on
  `TranscriptEntry.words`, `LiveWorker` load-shedding.
- *Stage 1 speaker re-ID:* `diarize_with_embeddings` (eres2net, per-cluster
  duration-weighted mean), `ProfileStore` (model-bound voiceprints, atomic JSON
  in the platform data dir), match-only greedy one-to-one relabel in the
  finalize pass, the `steno profiles` group (enroll/list/rename/remove,
  `--reinforce`, multi-speaker `--speakers`/`--speaker` enrolment), and the
  `--reid/--no-reid`/`--reid-threshold` wiring.
- *Stage 2 export & vocabulary:* SRT/VTT cue re-flow from word timestamps
  (time-overlapping per-speaker cues allowed, each labeled), and
  glossary/attendee post-correction (`stenograf.glossary`: difflib +
  umlaut/accent folding, word timing and punctuation preserved) behind the
  `--glossary`/`--glossary-file`/`--attendee`/`--glossary-threshold` family.
  Parakeet has no decode-time prompt, so post-correction is the honest lever
  ([[phase3-verified-library-constraints]]).
- *Stage 3 auto-detection:* local-speaker-count estimation (the mic channel
  passes `None` through like the system channel), detected counts surfaced as
  editable with a lock/correct re-run hint, and parameter provenance
  (`explicit|detected|default`) serialized into the transcript JSON.

**Phase 3→4 readiness audit + Tier-1 hardening. COMPLETE.** Four-subagent audit
verdict: architecturally ready for Phase 4 (the `CaptureProvider` and `LiveView`
seams are real and terminal-free). Tier-1 fixes shipped: thread-safe idempotent
capture teardown with the `serve()` template locked down (capture errors no
longer abort a finalizable buffer), the `stenograf.asr` lazy backend registry,
Linux test collection (`scipy` declared) + a model-free sherpa unit test, atomic
writes for every transcript/checkpoint artifact, and the small web-UI landmines
(`SpeakerProfile` hashability, `--local 0 --remote 0`, clamped count hints).

**Phase 4 Stages A, B, D, E — SHIPPED** (summaries under the build plan below).

**Phase 5 — Linux + cross-platform ASR. Tracks 1 + 2 SHIPPED (2026-07-11).**
Track 2 (the `parakeet-onnx` CPU backend) shipped on the Mac; Track 1 (Linux
capture via `parec`, `steno start` end-to-end with live captions) shipped the
next day on the CachyOS notebook, with the Ubuntu null-sink functional CI job.
Full technical sub-plan (Decision A/B/C verdicts included) at the end of the
Phase 4 build plan. **The stenodiar port SHIPPED 2026-07-11** — the CPU
throughput blocker fell to two vendored speakrs patches (measurement and
diagnosis in §2 "stenodiar on Linux"), so Linux now estimates speaker counts
through speakrs' VBx exactly like macOS (verified end-to-end: 3/3 speakers on
a three-voice fixture, `steno transcribe` at 5.0× realtime overall). Phase 5
has no open items; the Windows stenodiar throughput measurement stays
deferred with Windows itself.

**Development-environment plan (decided 2026-07-10).** Two machines, sequenced:

1. **Mac first — ONNX backend (Track 2).** Build `SherpaOnnxASRBackend`
   (`parakeet-onnx`) natively on macOS, where MLX and ONNX coexist — the only
   place the MLX↔ONNX parity harness can run. Settle **Decision A** here by
   probing whether the pinned `sherpa-onnx<1.13` yields Parakeet-v3 per-token
   timestamps (if not: `onnx-asr`). Also: platform-aware
   `default_backend_name()`, `doctor` strings, wheel dep markers.
2. **CachyOS notebook next — capture (Track 1) + throughput.** Development
   moves to Daniel's CachyOS (Arch, x86_64) notebook with VS Code + Claude
   Code. Real PipeWire/WirePlumber session, real mic/sinks: prototype both
   **Decision B** capture candidates (SoundCard `include_loopback` vs
   `parec`/`pw-record` subprocess) against `pactl`-discovered monitors — use
   `module-null-sink` + `paplay` for deterministic tests, real devices for the
   messy cases. Measure speakrs' ORT CPU throughput here (the x86 number that
   gates the stenodiar port). End-to-end runs: capture → finalize, compare
   against Mac output.
3. **GitHub Actions Ubuntu x86_64 — the stable-distro reference.** Functional
   transcription CI via the null-sink trick (load `module-null-sink`, `paplay`
   a fixture WAV, capture the monitor, assert text) + wheel-marker checks.
   Rationale: CachyOS is rolling/bleeding-edge (newest Python/PipeWire), Ubuntu
   LTS is the old end — the pair brackets the version range users actually run.
   Plain-PulseAudio (non-PipeWire) testing, if ever needed: a container on
   either machine.

No Linux VM on the Mac: the notebook covers real-hardware + x86_64, CI covers
stable-distro; nothing in the design touches ALSA directly, so these suffice.

### Open items & known deferrals (standing)

- **0d hand-labelled RTTM references** — the DER/word-attribution scorer is
  built and tested, but no references exist (Daniel's call not to hand-label),
  so diarization/re-ID quality stays unmeasured: the re-ID threshold stays at an
  untuned 0.5 and far-field local-speaker-count estimation is known to
  over-split (a small group measured as 8).
- **stenodiar on Windows** — the Linux port shipped 2026-07-11 (§2 "stenodiar
  on Linux"); Windows should inherit the same patched CPU build but its
  throughput is unmeasured; details in §2 "Deferred task — stenodiar on
  Windows".
- **Lower-priority, independent:** greedy re-ID → optimal (Hungarian)
  assignment; SRT/VTT dropping text not covered by `words` (latent — Parakeet
  emits full-or-none); helper-stderr piping; meeting-mode auto-detect; hybrid
  cross-channel dedup; acoustic first-segment LID for the live pass; a real
  Ollama notes e2e (needs a machine with Ollama installed).

### Phase 4 build plan — product layer + macOS distribution (Linux → Phase 5)

Planned July 2026 by a five-subagent design pass (web UI · persistence/archive ·
Linux backends · notes · distribution); all five stages are shipped and
summarized below. Stage C was re-scoped twice on 2026-07-10 — web UI →
reverse-control CLI → the final **de-scope to a pipeline** (below); the web UI
is dropped (its full W1–W8 design lives in this file's git history).

**Locked scope decisions (Daniel, July 2026):**
- **Product layer first; Linux deferred to Phase 5.** Phase 4 = a tangible
  Mac-native product (web UI + archive + notes) + the macOS shipping path.
  *(Amended 2026-07-10, twice: the web-UI leg was first re-scoped to a
  reverse-control CLI, then the whole management layer was de-scoped — see
  Stage C. The browser view is dropped; the TUI and the Obsidian note export
  cover its use cases.)*
- **`steno start` writes into a managed archive dir by default** —
  `data_dir()/meetings/<id>/transcript.*`; `--out PATH` overrides and still
  registers. Makes the archive an authoritative library, not an index over
  scattered files. *(Superseded 2026-07-10 by the Stage C de-scope: outputs
  move to a visible folder and the index is retired — the filesystem is the
  library.)*
- **In-RAM-only privacy guarantee preserved.** Audio never touches disk unless
  `--record-audio`. Text click-to-jump is *always* available (word timestamps
  live in the JSON); archive audio **playback** and archived **re-diarize** are
  opt-in, gated on one `record.has_audio()` predicate.

**Adopted recommendations still standing:** macOS signing stays **ad-hoc
only**; platform deps via **markers, not extras**; Windows **left installable**
with an honest `doctor`. (The notes-side recommendations shipped with Stage D,
below; the web-server recommendations — Starlette + uvicorn, vanilla-JS
no-build front-end, per-process token + Host/Origin guard — went to git history
with the dropped web UI.)

**Evaluation stays label-free** (Daniel's standing no-hand-labels call):
round-trip / property tests, fakes + headless `TestClient`, real-backend
end-to-end via `--replay`, and real-backend-gated e2e (Ollama and/or a real
`claude` CLI, skipped when absent) mirroring the model-gated ASR tests. No
accuracy scoring.

**Stage A — shared foundations: SHIPPED.** `Transcript.from_json` +
`SCHEMA_VERSION` (a faithful round-trip loader — the keystone the archive, the
web reader, and notes all build on; legacy/newer-version/unknown-key compat
rules included) and `MeetingProfile.title`.

**Stage B — persistence (archive + reverse control): SHIPPED.**
`stenograf.archive`: `MeetingArchive`/`MeetingRecord` with an atomic
`index.json` at `data_dir()/meetings/`, stable `meeting-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` ids
(collision-suffixed), a `reconcile()` self-heal (drops vanished dirs, adopts
orphans), `load_transcript(id)`, and the `has_audio()` predicate that gates
everything audio-dependent. CLI writes into the managed archive by default
(`--out` registering override, `--no-archive` flat-file escape hatch,
`--title`), with the `meetings list/show/rm` group. Reverse control:
`stenograf.control.MeetingSession` + `FinalizeRequest` (re-finalize with
sticky per-field overrides on the warm backends — counts/language/reid — plus
pure `rename_speaker`) and `ArchivedMeeting` (rename always works; refinalize
gated on `has_audio()`, rehydrating a per-channel store from the recorded WAV
and delegating to `MeetingSession`; persists via `MeetingArchive.rewrite`).
*(2026-07-10: the Stage C de-scope retires most of this layer — the index, the
`meetings` group, and the archived reverse control; what Stage B built and its
full build log remain in git history.)*

**Stage D — meeting notes: SHIPPED** (`stenograf.notes` + `stenograf.settings`;
verified against the real `claude` CLI via the `STENOGRAF_NOTES_E2E=1`-gated
test; a real-Ollama e2e is still pending). As built — **three** pluggable
backends behind an asr-style registry, one more than the original two-backend
design:
- **`mlx`** — in-process `mlx-lm`, **the zero-setup default on Apple Silicon**
  (chosen by `default_backend_name()` whenever `mlx_lm` imports); Qwen3 with
  thinking mode on by default; generation bound to the mlx_lm-import thread.
- **`ollama`** — stdlib-`urllib` HTTP to `localhost:11434`, default model
  `qwen3:8b`; no pip dependency.
- **`command`** — any configured CLI taking the prompt on stdin and emitting
  schema JSON on stdout (e.g. `claude -p`; Daniel's production path), typed
  errors, never a partial.

Shared core: the `MeetingNotes` model (title/summary/decisions/action-items/
highlights/open-questions + backend/model provenance), prompt builder +
whole-turn map-reduce chunking (the single-shot budget is a backend property),
schema-validated parsing, `steno notes <id|path>` + a non-fatal `--notes` flag
on `start`/`transcribe`, sibling `.notes.md`/`.notes.json` files, LLM-derived
titles back-filled into untitled archive records, combined-note export
(`[notes.export] dir` — Obsidian-friendly frontmatter + collapsible transcript),
and a `doctor` notes check. `settings.toml` outgrew the planned notes-only
scope into **six tables** (`[transcript]`, `[vocab]`, `[archive]`, `[speakers]`,
`[asr]`, `[notes]` + `[notes.export]`) with a `steno settings show/edit`
command; the library never reads settings — the CLI resolves
flag > env > file > default ([[settings-toml-architecture]]).

**Stage E — macOS distribution: SHIPPED. stenograf 0.1.0 is on PyPI;
`uv tool install stenograf` verified from a clean environment.** The
`hatch_build.py` wheel hook compiles + ad-hoc-signs stenocap into the tagged
arm64 wheel (pure `any` wheel elsewhere; fails loudly if `swiftc` is missing on
arm64), `requires-python <3.14` + a numba floor fix the resolver traps, atomic
model extraction, the signature verified through the wheel zip round-trip,
`steno setup` (one-time TCC prompts + model prefetch; `--models-only` for
headless CI), a CI matrix (macos-15 + ubuntu) and `release.yml` with
clean-install smoke tests and Trusted-Publishing. Release procedure: bump the
version, tag `vX.Y.Z`, push — release.yml does the rest.

**Stage C — de-scope to a pipeline: SHIPPED (2026-07-10; final re-scope, after
web UI → reverse-control CLI).** Decision (Daniel): stenograf's responsibility
ends at producing text — the full transcript and the notes/summary. Managing,
re-reading, and listening to recorded meetings is other tools' job (Obsidian
via the Stage D export, Finder/`ls`, any audio player), and **there is no
index at all** — the filesystem is the index. As built:

- **Visible output home** (`stenograf.output`): every run writes its own
  `meeting-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/` folder (on-disk collision suffixing; nothing is
  created until the first write) under `~/Documents/Meetings`, configurable
  via the `[output] dir` setting (the `[archive]` table is gone — a stale one
  gets a targeted rename error); `--out DIR` uses DIR itself as the meeting's
  folder. Plainly named `transcript.*`, notes siblings, optional `audio.wav`,
  and the `.partial` checkpoint all land together. Machine state (voiceprints,
  settings.toml, model cache) stays in the data dir — user documents do not.
- **Deleted:** `archive.py` (`MeetingArchive`/`MeetingRecord`/`reconcile`/
  `index.json`), the `meetings list/show/rm` group, `--archive/--no-archive` +
  the legacy flat layout, the index-side title back-fill (the exported note's
  filename carries the LLM title), and the orphaned reverse-control layer —
  `control.py` (`MeetingSession`, `ArchivedMeeting`, `AudioUnavailable`) and
  `pipeline.rename_entry_speaker`. `recording.read_channels` stays (the AEC
  eval rig consumes it). Re-processing a recorded meeting is what it always
  was: `steno transcribe <folder>/audio.wav --speakers N`.
- **`steno notes`** takes a meeting folder or transcript path, or `--last`
  (newest finished `meeting-*` folder in the output home, by name scan —
  crashed runs without a `transcript.json` are skipped).

Acceptance held: label-free CLI tests (outputs land in the visible home,
`--last` picks the newest, no index file is ever written) plus a real-backend
`--replay` e2e into a configured home. Everything deleted remains in git
history.

**Web UI: dropped (2026-07-10).** With no archive to browse there is nothing
left for a browser to show that the files themselves don't, and the TUI covers
live captions. The deferred design (W1–W8: Starlette server + token/Origin
security + archive/reader views + `steno serve`) lives in this file's git
history should it ever be wanted.

**Phase 5 technical sub-plan (Linux Track 2 — SHIPPED 2026-07-11; dev-environment
plan in §5).** A CPU/ONNX ASR backend
`stenograf/asr/parakeet_onnx.py::ParakeetOnnxBackend` (`name="parakeet-onnx"`) wrapping the
*same* Parakeet-TDT-v3 (fp32 ONNX, via `onnx-asr`), registered through the existing
`stenograf.asr` factory (`create_backend` already the seam — zero CLI change;
`default_backend_name()` went capability-based like the notes default, and the two `doctor`
strings changed). **Decision A — resolved to `onnx-asr`, on accuracy, not timestamps.**
The probe surprised: the pinned `sherpa-onnx<1.13` *does* decode Parakeet-v3 with real
per-token timestamps **and** TDT durations (~27× RT, 4 threads) — but its only published v3
export is **int8**, and int8 measurably degrades the transcript: cross-WER against MLX on
the eval WAVs was 4.1–20.8 % (int8, both sherpa's and onnx-asr's exports, German worst)
vs **2.0–6.8 % for fp32** — while fp32 on CPU ran *faster* (~36–44× RT, all cores). With
the accuracy-first charter that decided it; `quantization="int8"` stays available on the
backend for RAM-constrained boxes. onnx-asr returns token starts without durations, so word
ends are approximated (next token's start, capped at TDT's 4-frame/0.32 s duration ceiling
— can't move a word across a turn boundary farther than real durations could). Verification
(label-free, eval/parity.py): timestamp parity MLX↔ONNX median |Δstart| 0.00 s / p95 0.08 s
(one TDT frame); cross-WER within the fp32 band above. ORT's CoreML provider fails to
initialize on this model — the backend pins CPUExecutionProvider (GPU EPs a later opt-in).

**Track 1 — Linux capture: SHIPPED 2026-07-11** (on the CachyOS notebook, per the
dev-environment plan). `LinuxCaptureProvider` (`stenograf/capture/linux.py`, in-process, no
helper): one `parec` subprocess per channel, 16 kHz mono s16le resampled server-side (no
resampler dep), ~200 ms frames stamped per channel against a shared session clock (anchor at
first delivered frame, sample-count-derived after — the stenocap pattern), reader threads
that decouple the pipes from a stalled consumer, idempotent thread-safe `stop()`, and an
unexpected single-stream death tearing down the whole capture so the meeting ends visibly
and finalizes. **Decision B — resolved to `parec`** over SoundCard (`include_loopback`)
after prototyping both against the real PipeWire 1.6.7 session: parec adds zero Python
dependencies, mirrors the macOS subprocess architecture, and measured a clean ~86 ms
delivery cadence where SoundCard showed a ~1 s startup gap (`pw-record` was also ruled out:
it doesn't accept pulse monitor names). Device selection uses the pulse aliases, and they
are load-bearing, not convenience — measured: `@DEFAULT_MONITOR@` **follows** a
default-sink switch mid-capture (headset plugged in → WirePlumber moves the meeting app's
stream → capture follows), `@DEFAULT_SOURCE@` pins to the start-of-meeting mic, and a
*deviceless* parec does NOT track the pulse default under pipewire-pulse (WirePlumber
auto-routes it, never to a monitor). `pactl` resolves the aliases at provider construction
(fail-fast + the CLI names what will be recorded); `steno doctor` runs the same check.
Verified end-to-end on real capture (TTS meeting into a null sink → live captions →
verbatim finalize; dual-channel run exercised two streams + AEC on the shared clock).
Test-rig gotcha: a fresh `module-null-sink` loads **muted** here, and a muted sink's
monitor delivers silence. **Decision C** (settled): finalize-first is first-class, live
captions best-effort — measured on the notebook the window pass keeps up (finalize reused
live decodes, zero shed), so no separate CPU-RTF probe was built; `LiveWorker`
load-shedding already degrades an under-powered box to caption gaps the finalize fills.
Known-count diarization already runs ONNX/CPU via sherpa. Verification is
label-free throughout (parakeet-onnx↔MLX parity + timestamp sanity, reusing the Phase-2
agreement harness). Distribution: the wheel dep markers shipped with Track 2; the Ubuntu
functional-transcription CI job (null sink + piper TTS + live `steno start`, sentinel-word
assertion) shipped with Track 1.

**stenodiar port (estimated speaker counts on Linux) — SHIPPED 2026-07-11.** Acceleration
became build-time cargo features (`coreml`/`cuda`, default ORT CPU; `build.sh` passes
`coreml` on macOS, and the binary defaults to the best compiled-in backend); off-mac the
helper defaults to `--mode cpu` and `stenograf.diarization.speakrs.DEFAULT_MODE` follows the platform (the
only Python change — discovery, doctor, and the estimate/known-count split were already
platform-neutral). The advertised CPU throughput blocker was **diagnosed as two upstream
speakrs gaps and fixed by vendoring speakrs 0.5.0 with two single-hunk patches**
(`native/stenodiar/vendor/`, VENDOR.md; measurement matrix in §2 "stenodiar on Linux":
1.4× → 8.2× RT). Verified label-free on a synthesized three-voice piper meeting (307 s):
identical turns across all four patch configs, and end-to-end
`steno transcribe` (no `--speakers`) detected 3/3 speakers with correct attribution at
5.0× realtime overall, surfacing "3 detected — estimated" with the lock/correct hint.
First `--mode cpu` run downloads ~120 MB extra ONNX exports (the fast-path models) into
the HF cache; `--warmup` covers it.

*Settings portability (audited 2026-07-10):* `settings.toml` load/validate/show/edit is
already fully cross-platform — pure stdlib `tomllib`, `click.edit`, `os.replace` (atomic on
Windows too) — so Phase 5 inherits it as-is. Two small follow-ups when Windows becomes real:
`data_dir()` has no `win32` branch (data currently lands in `~/.local/share/stenograf`
instead of `%APPDATA%`; adding the branch implies a migration for early Windows users), and
backend-name validation is deliberately registry-level, not platform-aware (`backend = "mlx"`
validates anywhere; runnability is the backend's own check at use).

### Phase 6 plan — Windows (scoped 2026-07-11; capture track SHIPPED same day)

**Portability audit (2026-07-11, on the Windows 11 notebook).** Most of the stack is
already cross-platform by construction, so Windows is one big item (a capture provider)
plus small platform branches:

- **Already works / installable today:** the wheel installs cleanly (every MLX dep sits
  behind `sys_platform == 'darwin'` markers; the `hatch_build.py` hook is a no-op off
  macOS-arm64, so the Windows wheel is pure Python). `parakeet-onnx` is the unmarked
  cross-platform ASR default off-mac; VAD + known-count diarization are sherpa
  (ONNX/CPU); decoding is the bundled `imageio-ffmpeg` (ships win wheels); settings are
  audited portable (see above); the TUI is textual (Windows Terminal is supported);
  notes run via the `ollama`/`command` backends. `steno transcribe` and
  `steno start --replay` are expected to work unmodified — verifying that (pytest + a
  real transcribe) is step zero of the build.
- **The one big item — capture provider (`capture/windows.py`):** pure Python,
  in-process, mic from the default input + system audio via **WASAPI loopback** on the
  default output, behind the unchanged `CaptureProvider` ABC (mono 16 kHz int16, ~200 ms
  frames). Two design constraints settled by reading the core: (1) *shared clock* —
  both channels stamp against one session t=0 (the AEC aligns its far-end reference on
  it), same anchor-at-first-frame pattern as parec/stenocap. (2) *Silence gaps* —
  WASAPI loopback delivers **no packets while nothing renders**, making this the first
  gap-producing provider; that is safe because `SessionStore` places frames by
  timestamp and pads gaps with silence, so the provider must **re-anchor after a
  delivery gap** (arrival-time-based) instead of trusting sample-count-derived
  timestamps across the gap. The AEC side is already accounted for
  (`far_end_missing_ticks` + the armed-backstop warning), and a silent far end has no
  echo to cancel.
- **Decision D — loopback library: resolved to `soundcard`** (spiked on real hardware
  2026-07-11). One API covers mic + loopback, and it initializes WASAPI with
  `AUTOCONVERTPCM | SRC_DEFAULT_QUALITY`, so Windows resamples server-side to 16 kHz
  (parec-style — no Python resampler dep); pyaudiowpatch would have left native-rate
  resampling to us. Measured: recorder open 15–80 ms, first frame < 300 ms, exact
  200 ms delivery cadence, 440 Hz test tone recovered bit-clean through loopback —
  the ~1 s startup gap SoundCard showed under PipeWire (Decision B) is a Pulse-backend
  artifact and does not occur on its native Windows backend. Also verified in the
  spike: soundcard zero-fills loopback silence itself (wall-clock-estimated, hence
  the provider's re-anchor guard), recorders work from worker threads (COM), and
  `record(n)` returns within ~4 device periods even during silence, so `stop()` stays
  responsive.
- **Small platform branches:** `profiles.data_dir()` win32 branch (`%APPDATA%`) and
  `models.cache_dir()` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%`) — do these **before** Windows users exist
  (their docstrings already flag the migration cost of adding them late); `steno setup`
  messaging (no TCC equivalent — mic consent is a Windows privacy toggle / first-use
  prompt); the `Operating System :: Microsoft :: Windows` classifier; a
  `windows-latest` CI job running the unit suite (no null-sink equivalent exists, so
  live capture stays manually verified); confirm `livekit` win_amd64 wheels (the AEC
  wraps its APM — matters more on Windows, where laptop mics genuinely hear the
  speakers).
- **Deferred:** the on-device notes backend (decision on record:
  onnxruntime-genai-directml + Phi-4-mini) — Ollama/`command` cover Windows meanwhile;
  the stenodiar port (same speakrs CPU-throughput blocker as Linux, see §2).

**Sequencing:** baseline on the Windows box (pytest + real `steno transcribe`) →
data/cache dir branches → capture spike (Decision D) → `capture/windows.py` +
doctor/CLI wiring + fake-backed tests → CI job + classifier → DirectML notes backend
if Ollama proves not enough.

**Capture track — SHIPPED 2026-07-11** (on the Windows 11 notebook).
`WindowsCaptureProvider` (`stenograf/capture/windows.py`, in-process, no helper): one
pump thread per channel owning its device end to end (COM apartments are per-thread),
mic + default-output loopback downmixed to mono int16, ~200 ms frames on the shared
session clock (anchor at first delivered frame, sample-count-derived after — the
stenocap/parec pattern) **plus a forward-only re-anchor** when the derived clock falls
more than 0.5 s behind arrival-derived time, because soundcard's silence zero-fill is
wall-clock-estimated (`SessionStore` pads the skipped span; monotonicity preserved).
Idempotent thread-safe `stop()` via an Event; one stream dying tears down the whole
capture. Both devices pin to meeting-start defaults (WASAPI has no
`@DEFAULT_MONITOR@`-style following alias — accepted asymmetry vs Linux).
**Silent-failure detection** (Windows never prompts desktop apps for the mic — a
denied privacy toggle just yields zeros): `mic_access_blocked()` reads the
CapabilityAccessManager consent store (master / `NonPackaged` / machine-wide keys)
and `default_devices` raises before capture starts, naming the exact settings page —
so `steno doctor` and meeting start both fail loud; loopback is not privacy-gated, so
a system-only capture still passes. Backstop for causes the registry can't see
(hardware mute, dead device): the mic pump warns once on stderr after 5 s of
*exact-zero* PCM — real mics have a noise floor, so a zero run that long is a dead
stream, never a quiet room; a quiet *system* channel is normal and never warns. Wired:
`_base_provider` win32 branch, `doctor` capture check (names both devices),
`soundcard` win32 dep marker, `data_dir()`/`cache_dir()` win32 branches (`%APPDATA%` /
`%LOCALAPPDATA%`, landed *before* any Windows users per the audit). Verified: 24
fake-backed unit tests (mirroring the linux suite, incl. a fake-clock re-anchor test)
+ a real-hardware smoke (3 s mic+loopback with a 440 Hz tone: exact cadence, tone
recovered, 81 ms anchor skew between channels). The baseline sweep made the full suite
green on Windows — **555 passed** — by fixing POSIX assumptions *in tests* (raw
Windows paths inside TOML fixtures, locale-encoded `read_text`, exec-bit asserts,
SIGINT-based macOS-provider teardown now skipped on win32) and **one real product
bug**: on Windows, piped/redirected output uses the legacy code page and `click.echo`
crashed on ✓/← — the CLI entry now reconfigures stdout/stderr with
`errors="replace"` on win32. `livekit` win_amd64 wheels confirmed (1.1.13 installs;
AEC behaviour on Windows hardware still to be exercised). Still open in Phase 6: real
`steno transcribe`/`steno start` with downloaded models, the `windows-latest` CI job +
Windows classifier, setup messaging, the DirectML notes backend, the stenodiar port,
and the Windows leg of the Phase-7 install story (deferred there 2026-07-12): an
`install.ps1` one-liner (uv ships `irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex`) plus
the win32 branch of `stenograf/shortcut.py` — a Desktop `.lnk`, or simpler a `.cmd`
wrapper, since `steno.exe` is a console app and any shortcut to it opens its own
console window; `install_shortcut()` currently returns `None` on win32 so `steno
setup` stays silent there.

### Phase 7 plan — `steno` launcher TUI (planned 2026-07-12)

**Goal.** Make the tool usable by people who don't live in a terminal: one
command — bare `steno` — opens a mouse-driven, button-based Textual app that
walks the user through *start a live meeting → transcribe a recording →
generate notes*, plus a double-clickable launcher so they never type the
command at all. The CLI subcommands stay the primary scripting interface and
are untouched.

**Scope decision (recorded 2026-07-12).** Two tiers were considered for the
non-terminal audience. **Tier 1 — this phase**: the Textual launcher +
auto-generated desktop shortcuts (`.command` on macOS, `.desktop` with
`Terminal=true` on Linux, `.lnk` on Windows). **Tier 2 — deliberately
deferred, not designed**: a system-tray app (`pystray`/`rumps`) with packaged
signed installers (PyInstaller/Briefcase). Tier 2 is a phase-sized project
(bundling the ONNX/MLX stacks; on macOS the capture TCC permission would
attach to the new app bundle, reworking the `doctor`/`setup` permission flow)
and is not worth building before real non-terminal users ask to double-click
an installer. A browser UI is off the table regardless — the no-web-UI
philosophy lock (§ product philosophy) is load-bearing here.

**Download-artifact research (2026-07-12, Task 6 reframe).** A GitHub-page
"download and double-click" install was researched and **deferred**: macOS
Tahoe hard-blocks any unsigned downloaded `.command` (empirically tested — the
dialog offers only *Move to Trash / Done*; the escape is System Settings →
"Open Anyway" + admin password, unshippable to non-terminal users). Zipping
doesn't help (Archive Utility propagates quarantine) and bare scripts cannot
be notarized (tickets attach only to Mach-O/.app/.pkg/.dmg), so a downloadable
artifact requires a $99/yr Apple Developer ID + a notarized wrapper — the
proven shape is a tiny notarized `.app` that opens Terminal via LaunchServices
(Ollama/ComfyUI pattern; TCC grants then still attach to Terminal.app, so the
`setup`/`doctor` permission flow survives). Revisit alongside Tier 2. Tier 1
instead ships a **one-command install**: `install.sh` at the repo root
(README one-liner via `curl | sh`) bootstraps uv → `uv tool install stenograf`
→ `steno setup`, and `setup` now drops the launcher — locally written files
carry no quarantine flag, so the double-click story starts *after* the one
terminal moment.

**Library decision: Textual** — already a dependency (the live-caption view),
full mouse support (buttons, focus-follows-click, scroll, hover) in every
terminal we target, real widgets (`Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `DirectoryTree`,
`ProgressBar`, modal screens), and one codebase across all three platforms.
No alternatives owed a spike: `prompt_toolkit` is a widget layer we'd have to
build ourselves, `urwid` is dated, Rich alone isn't interactive.

**Architecture.** One long-lived `StenografApp`; each workflow is a `Screen`
pushed onto its stack, one module per screen in a new `stenograf/ui/` package
(mirroring `cli/`'s one-module-per-command layout):

- `HomeScreen` — large labeled buttons: Start meeting / Transcribe a
  recording / Generate notes / Settings / Doctor.
- `MeetingSetupScreen` — the few choices that matter (profile, language,
  notes on/off), defaults resolved from settings.toml through the same
  resolution helpers the CLI uses (`cli/run.py`).
- `MeetingScreen` — **today's `LiveApp` converted from `App` to
  `Screen[Transcript]`** (see below). Its DONE phase becomes a results view
  with next actions ("Open folder", "Generate notes") instead of "q to exit".
- `TranscribeScreen` — `DirectoryTree` file picker → pipeline in a
  `@work(thread=True)` worker → `ProgressBar` driven by the existing
  `transcribe` progress callback.
- `NotesScreen` — "last meeting" default (the `notes --last` semantics) plus
  a plain file dialog. **Guardrail:** this screen stays a dumb file picker —
  never a meeting list with metadata; that would be the meeting browser the
  product philosophy forbids, and keeping the screen dumb enforces the lock
  structurally.
- `SettingsScreen` / `DoctorScreen` — read-only rendering of `settings show`
  with an "open in $EDITOR" button; doctor output in a scrollable log. A
  settings *form* is where TUI effort balloons — explicitly out of scope.

**The one structurally risky piece — `LiveApp` → `MeetingScreen`.** The
`compose()`, CSS, `push_*` methods, bindings, and the 1 Hz tick move nearly
verbatim (Screens support all of them). What changes is lifecycle: instead of
the meeting thread exiting the app, the screen `dismiss(transcript)`es back to
Home via Textual's typed screen results. `steno start` keeps working unchanged
by running the *same* app with `MeetingScreen` as the initial screen and
exiting on its dismissal — one codepath, two entries; no CLI-TUI/launcher-TUI
fork. This conversion is done **early** (Task 2), while it's small.

**What deliberately does not change** (these seams are why the launcher is
cheap):

- **`LiveView` stays the only live-event channel.** `TextualLiveView` keeps
  marshalling worker-thread events via `call_from_thread`; it just targets the
  screen instead of the app. `PlainLiveView`, the batch echoes, and the
  orchestrator are untouched. No new event paths.
- **The UI is a fourth thin client of the library** (same C7 rule as the CLI):
  screens gather inputs and call library entry points; logic a screen needs
  that the CLI lacks goes into the library, never the screen.
- **The minimal-redraw budget** (TEXTUAL_FPS pinning, `animation_level =
  "none"`, one 1 Hz timer) moves up to `StenografApp` and covers every screen.
  The import-order-sensitive FPS pinning lives in one module both `tui` and
  `ui` import first.
- **Lazy imports:** bare `steno` reaches `ui` through the click group
  (`invoke_without_command=True`) the same way `start` imports `tui` today —
  pipes and scripts never pay the Textual import.

**Maintainability rules.**

1. Screens never run domain work inline: anything slow (transcribe, finalize,
   notes, doctor) runs in a `@work(thread=True)` worker; blocking the loop
   freezes rendering *and* deadens bindings (the `action_stop` lesson).
2. Exception to rule 1: notes generation goes through the existing notes entry
   point only — the MLX backend is bound to its import thread
   ([[mlx-weights-thread-local-streams]]); never a fresh worker calling
   `mlx_lm`.
3. Every screen keeps plain-text mirrors of what it renders (the
   `committed_lines` / `header_text()` pattern), so tests under Textual's
   `run_test()` pilot assert behavior without scraping widget internals.
4. Screens start dumb and grow only on demand (read-only settings, plain file
   dialogs).

**Sequencing** (each task ships working; none blocks Phase 5/6 work):

1. `stenograf/ui/` package + `StenografApp` + `HomeScreen`; bare `steno`
   launches it (buttons may be stubs).
2. `LiveApp` → `MeetingScreen` conversion + its tests; `steno start` runs the
   same screen directly (the risky bit, done early).
3. `MeetingSetupScreen` with settings-backed defaults; Home → Setup → Meeting
   → results end to end.
4. `TranscribeScreen` (picker + worker + progress).
5. `NotesScreen` + read-only `SettingsScreen`/`DoctorScreen`.
6. `steno setup` drops the platform launcher (`.command` / `.desktop` /
   `.lnk`) and the README gains the "for non-terminal users" paragraph.

**Status: Tasks 1–6 SHIPPED 2026-07-12 — Tier 1 is complete.** The launcher
TUI covers every workflow (Tasks 1–5: every Home button opens a real screen;
workflow pipelines run in thread workers with plain-text mirrors for the
tests). Task 6 shipped as reframed above: `stenograf/shortcut.py` writes the
launcher (`~/Desktop/Stenograf.command` on macOS, a `Terminal=true` `.desktop`
menu entry on Linux — GNOME desktops need a manual "allow launching" for
desktop *files*, menu entries don't; Windows `.lnk` deferred to Phase 6) with
the absolute interpreter + `-m stenograf` (new `__main__.py`) so a login-shell
PATH without uv's shims can't break it; `steno setup` installs it (skipped
under `--models-only` — headless/CI); `install.sh` + README one-liner do the
rest. Two naming landmines for future screens: never define `_running` or
`_render` on a Screen — both shadow Textual internals (`MessagePump._running`,
`Widget._render`) and break the screen silently.
